        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>A simple egg custard is used to coat your favourite bread before being fried and covered in sugar. Served with a handful of berries and a dollop of Greek yogurt for the perfect brunch</p>

        <ul>
            <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>3 tbsp whole milk</li>
            <li>3 tbsp double cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 thick slices of sourdough</li>
            <li>Â½ tsp mixed spice</li>
            <li>25g caster sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <li>Lightly beat the eggs in a shallow bowl with the milk, cream and vanilla. Dip the bread in the bowl, allowing to soak for 1-2 mins on each side. You may want to do this in batches.</li>
            <li>Mix the mixed spice into the sugar on a large plate.</li>
            <li>Heat the butter in a non-stick frying pan and cook the bread for 2 mins on each side. Press the bread carefully into the sugar on each side before transferring to a plate. Serve with Greek yogurt and berries, if you like.</li>
        </ol>
